# MixFishSim
Code for mixed fishery multi-stock simulation model

This package is for:

- Highly spatially and temporally resolved simulation of fish population dynamics for multiple species,
- Individual-based fishing simulation of fishing fleet dynamics for analysing the effects of mixed-fisheries on multiple populations.
