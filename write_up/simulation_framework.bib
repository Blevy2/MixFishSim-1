abstract = {Seasonal area closures of fisheries are primarily used to reduce fishing mortality on target species. In the absence of effort controls, fishing vessels displaced from a closed area will impact fish populations and the environment elsewhere. Based on the observed response of the North Sea beam trawl fleet to the closure of the "cod box" and an existing size-based model of the impacts of beam trawling, we predict the effects of seasonal area closures on benthic communities in the central North Sea. We suggest that repeated seasonal area closures would lead to a slightly more homogeneous distribution of annual trawling activity, although the distribution would remain patchy rather than random. The increased homogeneity, coupled with the displacement of trawling activity to previously unfished areas, is predicted to have slightly greater cumulative impacts on total benthic invertebrate production and lead to localized reductions in benthic biomass for several years. To ensure the effective integration of fisheries and environmental management, the wider consequences of fishery management actions should be considered a priori. Thus, when seasonal closures increase the homogeneity of overall disturbance or lead to the redistribution of trawling activity to environmentally sensitive or previously unfished areas, then effort reductions or permanent area closures should be considered as a management option. The latter would lead to a single but permanent redistribution of fishing disturbance, with lower cumulative impacts on benthic communities in the long run. ?? 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {This study presents a fleet-based bioeconomic simulation model to the international mixed flatfish fishery in the North Sea. The model uses a Management Strategies Evaluation framework including a discrete choice model accounting for short-term temporal changes in effort allocation across fisheries. A simplified random utility model was used based on the expected revenue (or economic attractiveness) and two tradition parameters related to short and long term historical fishing patterns. All three parameters were significant. Even though reactions and adaptations vary between fleets, the estimated conservative behaviour of the main fleets led to only marginal effect at the stock level. The importance of accounting for fleet behaviour was then evaluated using an elasticity analysis to explore how increased weight of economic attractiveness contributes to changes in the biological output and positive increase in the economic performance of the individual fleets. This showed the existence of a window of sensitivity of the model to the behaviour assumptions. The study highlights the challenge of implementing an effort allocation model in a general framework of Management Strategies Evaluation for mixed-fisheries, and illustrates the necessary trade-offs between very detailed numerical relationships and the representation of aggregated processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

A simulation strategy for fleet dynamics in Australia's northern prawn fishery: effort allocation at two scales. – {\{}ICES{\}} Journal of Marine Science, 66: 631–645. We describe simple and effective methods for simulating the movement of a fishing fleet, the spatio-temporal allocation of effort, in the context of harvest policy evaluation. Vessel movements are simulated in a manner that can balance established seasonal fishing patterns with the influence of perceived local variations in abundance. In the longer term, the model adapts smoothly to changes in fleet size and price fluctuations in critical resources, such as fuel. Given an initial allocation of effort at a fine temporal (but coarse spatial) scale, as needed for projecting stock dynamics, a second phase assigns the effort at a finer spatial (but coarser temporal) scale for environmental impact assessment. The first phase is based on a discrete-state, time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, with transition probabilities following a multiple logistic model. Although the ideas are generic, the method has been developed for the specific case of Australia's northern prawn fishery, which is used to motivate and describe the method. The approach, in a harvest policy evaluation context, is novel in that it uses economic projections (not surrogates) to reflect realistically the recent pressures many fishing industries are under to change their spatial fishing pattern in response to global fuel price fluctuations.},

Individual quotas, fishing effort allocation, and over-quota discarding in mixed fisheries. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 323–333. Many fisheries are managed by total allowable catches (TACs) and a substantial part by individual quotas. Such output management has not been successful in mixed fisheries when fishers continue to fish while discarding marketable fish. We analyse the effects of individual quotas on spatial and temporal effort allocation and over-quota discarding in a multispecies fishery. Using a spatially explicit dynamic-state variable model, the optimal fishing strategy of fishers constrained by annual individual quotas, facing uncertainty in catch rates, is studied. Individual fishers will move away from areas with high catches of the restricted quota species and, depending on the cost of fishing, will stop fishing in certain periods of the year. Individual vessels will discard marketable fish, but only after their individual quota for the species under consideration has been reached. These results are in line with observations on effort allocation and discarding of marketable fish, both over-quota discarding and highgrading, by the Dutch beam-trawl fleet. The models we present can be used to predict the outcomes of management and are therefore a useful tool for fisheries scientists and managers.},

@article{Wilen2002,
abstract = {All fisheries-management models incorporate simplifying assumptions about ecological and oceanographic mechanisms that are fundamentally uncertain or stochastic, but exploited fisheries are also subject to equally important uncertainties associated with fisherman behavior. Fishermen make decisions ranging from long-term entry/exit decisions to daily or even hourly decisions about where and how to fish. These decisions are influenced by regulations, technology, weather, and expectations about prices, costs, and abundance. They ultimately determine the spatial and temporal pattern of mortality in an exploited fishery. Although biologists have tried to incorporate fisherman behavior into management models, much of the work is ad hoc, whereas economics has a rich tradition of both conceptual and empirical behavioral modeling. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate the potential usefulness of economics-based behavioral modeling, with data collected for biological management. A model of participation and spatial choice is constructed, and the economic model is linked to a biological model of metapopulation dynamics and used to forecast the implications of management measures that might be applied to the red sea urchin fishery in California. The results show that modeling spatial behavior strongly affects the predicted outcomes of management policies even if the policies are not spatial in character.},

abstract = {Single-species management is a cause of discarding in mixed fisheries, because individual management objectives may not be consist- ent with each other and the species are caught simultaneously in relatively unselective fishing operations. As such, the total allowable catch (TAC) of one species may be exhausted before the TAC of another, leading to catches of valuable fish that cannot be landed legally. This important issue is, however, usually not quantified and not accounted for in traditional management advice. A simple approach using traditional catch and effort information was developed, estimating catch potentials for distinct fleets (groups of vessels) and me ´tiers (type of activity), and hence quantifying the risks of over- and underquota utilization for the various stocks. This method, named Fcube (Fleet and Fisheries Forecast), was applied successfully to international demersal fisheries in the North Sea and shaped into the advice framework. The substantial overquota catches of North Sea cod likely under the current fisheries regimes are quantified, and it is estimated that the single-species management targets for North Sea cod cannot be achieved unless substantial reductions in TACs of all other stocks and corresponding effort reductions are applied.},

@article{Hutton2004,
abstract = {Numerous studies have proposed methodologies to model fisher behaviour with the aim of predicting the outcomes of decision-making on board a fishing vessel. Both short- and long-term processes (e.g. investment) impact fleet dynamics. The proposed structure of the models has tended to depend upon the nature of the fishery and the control variables (technical restrictions, quotas, effort control, and/or closed areas). For example, within the context of multi-stock, multi-fleet fisheries (mixed fisheries), a skipper will allocate effort (as input to the production process) to harvest a range of species. Spatial complexity is normally excluded in models of behaviour. In this paper, two spatial analyses are presented for modelling location choice: an analysis based on a random utility model (RUM), and a simplified simulation model of individual vessels that depends on the results of the RUM. These models are applied to the English beam-trawl fleet operating in the North Sea in 2000. The results from the RUM indicate that the number of trips, the average trip length, and the average effort in each ICES rectangle are significant variables affecting location choice, in addition to catch rate for the previous year (1999), weighted by value. The last result is used as an assumption in a simulation model of fishing effort, i.e. fishers make decisions on spatial location of operation on the basis of past catch rates. The simulation model is used to predict the distribution of the same fleet for one month during the temporary closure in the North Sea in 2001. The predicted values for effort relate well to the fishing patterns observed. Crown Copyright ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and socialpsychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},

Changes involve each individual in a decision-making process governed by his/her own goals or constraints. Despite this reality. the complex dynamics of fishing has usually been ignored in designing management initiatives. which has contributed to management failures in many parts of the world. Fishers have generally been treated as fixed elements, with no consideration of individual attitudes based on their operating scales (geographical, ecological. social and economic) and personal goals. We review existing research on the social. economic and behavioural dynamics of fishing to provide insight into fisher behaviour and its implications for fisheries management. Emphasis is placed on fisher perception. and how fishers develop dynamic fishing tactics and strategies as an adaptive response to changes in resource abundance, environmental conditions and market or regulatory constraints. We conclude that knowledge of these dynamics is essential for effective management, and we discuss how such information can be collected. analysed and integrated into fisheries assessment and management. Particular emphasis is placed on small-scale fisheries. but some examples from industrial fleets are provided to highlight similar issues in different types of fisheries.},

abstract = {A discrete choice model is applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the English and Welsh North Sea beam trawl fleet. Individual vessels can fish in five distinct areas, and the utility of fishing in an area depends on expected revenue measured as previous success (value per unit effort) and experience (past fishing effort allocation), as well as perceived costs (measured as distance to landing port weighted by fuel price). The model predicts fisher location choice, and the predictions are evaluated using iterative partial cross validation by fitting the model over a series of separate time-periods (nine separate time-periods). Results show the relative importance of the different drivers that change over time. They indicate that there are three main drivers throughout the study, past annual effort, past monthly effort in the year of fishing, and fuel price, largely reflecting the fact that previous practices where success was gained are learned (i.e. experience) and become habitual, and that seasonal variations also dominate behaviour in terms of the strong monthly trends and variable costs. In order to provide an indication of the model's predictive capabilities, a simulated closure of one of the study areas was undertaken (an area that mapped reasonably well with the North Sea cod 2001 partial closure of the North Sea for 10 weeks of that year). The predicted reallocation of effort was compared against realized/observed reallocation of effort, and there was good correlation at the trip level, with a maximum 10{\%} misallocation of predicted effort for that year. ?? 2012.},

We showed that our algorithm led to an effective food-searching performance compared with a simple random walk algorithm and exhibited super-diffusion properties, despite the uniform step lengths.

Fished populations have been heavily fished over a wide range of stock sizes, and the data for such stocks are potentially of great interest. Population variability in stock histories has focused attention on the predictability of conditions of sustainability when harvesting fish. Here, I examine empirically the time-series data on 27 commercial fish stocks in the North Atlantic. The variability in population growth rate (i.e. the annual changes in the logarithms of population abundance) is described by a Gaussian distribution. The signs (up or down) of successive changes in the population trajectory are independent, as if determined by the toss of a coin. The process of population variability therefore corresponds to a geometric random walk.},

abstract = {1. Search processes play an important role in physical, chemical and biological systems. In animal foraging, the search strategy predators should use to search optimally for prey is an enduring question. Some models demonstrate that when prey is sparsely distributed, an optimal search pattern is a specialised random walk known as a L{\'{e}}vy flight, whereas when prey is abundant, simple Brownian motion is sufficiently efficient. These predictions form part of what has been termed the L{\'{e}}vy flight foraging hypothesis (LFF) which states that as L{\'{e}}vy flights optimise random searches, movements approximated by optimal L{\'{e}}vy flights may have naturally evolved in organisms to enhance encounters with targets (e.g. prey) when knowledge of their locations is incomplete. 2. Whether free-ranging predators exhibit the movement patterns predicted in the LFF hypothesis in response to known prey types and distributions, however, has not been determined. We tested this using vertical and horizontal movement data from electronic tagging of an apex predator, the great white shark Carcharodon carcharias, across widely differing habitats reflecting different prey types. 3. Individual white sharks exhibited movement patterns that predicted well the prey types expected under the LFF hypothesis. Shark movements were best approximated by Brownian motion when hunting near abundant, predictable sources of prey (e.g. seal colonies, fish aggregations), whereas movements approximating truncated L{\'{e}}vy flights were present when searching for sparsely distributed or potentially difficult-to-detect prey in oceanic or shelf environments, respectively. 4. That movement patterns approximated by truncated L{\'{e}}vy flights and Brownian behaviour were present in the predicted prey fields indicates search strategies adopted by white sharks appear to be the most efficient ones for encountering prey in the habitats where such patterns are observed. This suggests that C. carcharias appears capable of exhibiting search patterns that are approximated as optimal in response to encountered changes in prey type and abundance, and across diverse marine habitats, from the surf zone to the deep ocean. 5. Our results provide some support for the LFF hypothesis. However, it is possible that the observed L{\'{e}}vy patterns of white sharks may not arise from an adaptive behaviour but could be an emergent property arising from simple, straight-line movements between complex (e.g. fractal) distributions of prey. Experimental studies are needed in vertebrates to test for the presence of L{\'{e}}vy behaviour patterns in the absence of complex prey distributions.},

abstract = {Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Le´vy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Le´vy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain Le´vy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Le´vy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Le´vy walks. This model shows that Le´vy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing Le´vy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.},

abstract = {Many free-ranging predators have to make foraging decisions with little, if any, knowledge of present resource distribution and availability. The optimal search strategy they should use to maximize encounter rates with prey in heterogeneous natural environments remains a largely unresolved issue in ecology. L{\'{e}}vy walks are specialized random walks giving rise to fractal movement trajectories that may represent an optimal solution for searching complex landscapes. However, the adaptive significance of this putative strategy in response to natural prey distributions remains untested. Here we analyse over a million movement displacements recorded from animal-attached electronic tags to show that diverse marine predators-sharks, bony fishes, sea turtles and penguins-exhibit L{\'{e}}vy-walk-like behaviour close to a theoretical optimum. Prey density distributions also display L{\'{e}}vy-like fractal patterns, suggesting response movements by predators to prey distributions. Simulations show that predators have higher encounter rates when adopting L{\'{e}}vy-type foraging in natural-like prey fields compared with purely random landscapes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that observed search patterns are adapted to observed statistical patterns of the landscape. This may explain why L{\'{e}}vy-like behaviour seems to be widespread among diverse organisms, from microbes to humans, as a 'rule' that evolved in response to patchy resource distributions.},

abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

For management strategy, an equation is derived that characterizes the economic optimal state of exploitation of a modeled stock. A further generalization is derived to account for those species where recruitment to the mature stock occurs over many age-categories. Since the parameters all have phenomenological definitions, they can be estimated from information independent of the model. These parameters can also be estimated by regression of the model to catch and effort data. Test regressions of the general model are made on catch and effort data from three exploited fish stocks: the yellowtail flounder of New England, the Pacific halibut of Area II, and the haddock of Georges Bank; the corresponding R2 values are 0.75, 0.87, and 0.86. Although the confidence intervals for individual parameter estimates are very large, the estimates compare favorably with published parameter values. Since only certain combinations of parameters from the general model appear to have low sensitivity to small perturbations to the data, some guiding suggestions are made that may lead to an improved robustness in the statistical procedures.Key words: age-structured model, optimal harvesting strategy, spawner–recruit curves, parameter estimation.},

The model uses a Management Strategies Evaluation framework including a discrete choice model accounting for short-term temporal changes in effort allocation across fisheries. A simplified random utility model was used based on the expected revenue (or economic attractiveness) and two tradition parameters related to short and long term historical fishing patterns. All three parameters were significant. Even though reactions and adaptations vary between fleets, the estimated conservative behaviour of the main fleets led to only marginal effect at the stock level. The importance of accounting for fleet behaviour was then evaluated using an elasticity analysis to explore how increased weight of economic attractiveness contributes to changes in the biological output and positive increase in the economic performance of the individual fleets. This showed the existence of a window of sensitivity of the model to the behaviour assumptions. The study highlights the challenge of implementing an effort allocation model in a general framework of Management Strategies Evaluation for mixed-fisheries, and illustrates the necessary trade-offs between very detailed numerical relationships and the representation of aggregated processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

A simulation strategy for fleet dynamics in Australia's northern prawn fishery: effort allocation at two scales. – {\{}ICES{\}} Journal of Marine Science, 66: 631–645. We describe simple and effective methods for simulating the movement of a fishing fleet, the spatio-temporal allocation of effort, in the context of harvest policy evaluation. Vessel movements are simulated in a manner that can balance established seasonal fishing patterns with the influence of perceived local variations in abundance. In the longer term, the model adapts smoothly to changes in fleet size and price fluctuations in critical resources, such as fuel. Given an initial allocation of effort at a fine temporal (but coarse spatial) scale, as needed for projecting stock dynamics, a second phase assigns the effort at a finer spatial (but coarser temporal) scale for environmental impact assessment. The first phase is based on a discrete-state, time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, with transition probabilities following a multiple logistic model. Although the ideas are generic, the method has been developed for the specific case of Australia's northern prawn fishery, which is used to motivate and describe the method. The approach, in a harvest policy evaluation context, is novel in that it uses economic projections (not surrogates) to reflect realistically the recent pressures many fishing industries are under to change their spatial fishing pattern in response to global fuel price fluctuations.},

abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in R{\^{}}2 only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat{\'{e}}rn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of R{\^{}}2, between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

It contains detailed numerical methods for parameter estimation, confidence bounds, and the formulation of harvesting strategies. The book builds upon the three themes in the subtitle. Choice refers to alternative management actions and alternative models. Dynamics reviews basic concepts of ecology and the interactions between fish and fishermen, as the latter respond to biological variability and to economic opportunity and regulation. Uncertainty describes the all-pervasive feature of fish stocks assessment. This text, written by two highly respected authorities in the field, should also become a standard reference in the area for professionals. It is clearly written at the level accessible to senior undergraduates and is easily understandable without advanced calculus and linear algebra.

abstract = {SignificanceFood security and the economic well-being of millions of people depend on sustainable fisheries, which require innovative approaches to management that can balance ecological, economic, and social objectives. We offer empirical evidence that dynamic ocean management, or real-time ocean management, can increase the efficacy and efficiency of fisheries management over static approaches by better aligning human and ecological scales of use. Furthermore, we show that dynamic management can address critical ecological patterns previously considered to be largely intractable in fisheries management (e.g., competition, niche partitioning, predation, parasitism, or social aggregations) at appropriate scales. The evidence and theory offered supports the use of dynamic ocean management in a range of scenarios to improve the ecological, economic, and social sustainability of fisheries. In response to the inherent dynamic nature of the oceans and continuing difficulty in managing ecosystem impacts of fisheries, interest in the concept of dynamic ocean management, or real-time management of ocean resources, has accelerated in the last several years. However, scientists have yet to quantitatively assess the efficiency of dynamic management over static management. Of particular interest is how scale influences effectiveness, both in terms of how it reflects underlying ecological processes and how this relates to potential efficiency gains. Here, we address the empirical evidence gap and further the ecological theory underpinning dynamic management. We illustrate, through the simulation of closures across a range of spatiotemporal scales, that dynamic ocean management can address previously intractable problems at scales associated with coactive and social patterns (e.g., competition, predation, niche partitioning, parasitism, and social aggregations). Furthermore, it can significantly improve the efficiency of management: as the resolution of the closures used increases (i.e., as the closures become more targeted), the percentage of target catch forgone or displaced decreases, the reduction ratio (bycatch/catch) increases, and the total time-area required to achieve the desired bycatch reduction decreases. In the scenario examined, coarser scale management measures (annual time-area closures and monthly full-fishery closures) would displace up to four to five times the target catch and require 100-200 times more square kilometer-days of closure than dynamic measures (grid-based closures and move-on rules). To achieve similar reductions in juvenile bycatch, the fishery would forgo or displace between USD 15-52 million in landings using a static approach over a dynamic management approach.},

abstract = {High-resolution fisheries data from integrated logbook and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) records have revealed a detailed spatial structure in the species composition of the retained catches of the Irish demersal otter trawl fleets. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to define 8 clusters with relatively homogenous species compositions. These clusters formed 34 distinct spatial regions in the waters around Ireland. Identification of these regions can be useful for a number applications, including spatial stratification of commercial or survey data, defining and characterising fishing grounds for marine spatial planning, evaluation of closed areas and prediction of how fishing effort might be re-allocated following a closure. A case-study is presented that explores options to reduce cod (Gadus morhua) catches by implementing seasonal closures in two of the 34 regions. Cod are caught by demersal trawlers in a mixed fishery and the catches often exceed the quota, resulting in discarding of marketable fish. Two regions were identified that had relatively low effort and high cod landings. The effects of closing these regions during the first quarter of the year were explored. Cod catches were likely to be reduced by 8-22{\%} while only 3-9{\%} of the annual demersal otter trawl effort would be displaced. Whiting catches were also likely to be reduced, the change in catches of some other species depended on the assumed effort displacement. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Single-species management is a cause of discarding in mixed fisheries, because individual management objectives may not be consist- ent with each other and the species are caught simultaneously in relatively unselective fishing operations. As such, the total allowable catch (TAC) of one species may be exhausted before the TAC of another, leading to catches of valuable fish that cannot be landed legally. This important issue is, however, usually not quantified and not accounted for in traditional management advice. A simple approach using traditional catch and effort information was developed, estimating catch potentials for distinct fleets (groups of vessels) and me ´tiers (type of activity), and hence quantifying the risks of over- and underquota utilization for the various stocks. This method, named Fcube (Fleet and Fisheries Forecast), was applied successfully to international demersal fisheries in the North Sea and shaped into the advice framework. The substantial overquota catches of North Sea cod likely under the current fisheries regimes are quantified, and it is estimated that the single-species management targets for North Sea cod cannot be achieved unless substantial reductions in TACs of all other stocks and corresponding effort reductions are applied.},

Caveats associated with the method are identified, and the biases introduced by our assumptions are quantified. Application of the method provides a high-resolution description of gear-specific fishing activity by UK vessels. An index is developed to describe variation in the spatial pattern of fishing effort generated by different gears. The proposed method for VMS analysis involves removing duplicate VMS records and records close to ports, calculating the time interval between successive records to identify periods of activity, linking each record to a vessel and gear type, differentiating fishing and non-fishing activity, and summing fishing records in time and space to estimate fishing effort. The approach is a step towards the development of standardized methods to facilitate wider exchange and use of European VMS data.

Observed trajectories of fishing vessels are well modeled by L{\'{e}}vy random walks, suggesting that fishermen use a stochastic search strategy which conforms to the same search statistics as non-human predators. We show that human skills (technology, communication, or others) do not result in the fishermen's spatial behavior being fundamentally different from that of animal predators.

abstract = {This study provides an update of the quantity of discards in the worlds marine fisheries based on a fishery-by-fishery approach. The weighted discard rate is estimated at 8 percent (proportion of the catch discarded). Based on this discard rate, in the 1992 2001 period, yearly average discards are estimated to be 7.3 million tonnes. Because of the different method used in the current estimate, it is not directly comparable with the previous estimates of 27 million and 20 million tonnes. Trawl fisheries for shrimp and demersal finfish account for over 50 percent of total estimated discards while representing approximately 22 percent of total landings recorded in the study. Tropical shrimp trawl fisheries have the highest discard rate and account for over 27 percent of total estimated discards. Demersal finfish trawls account for 36 percent of the estimated global discards. Most purse-seine, handline, jig, trap and pot fisheries have low discard rates. Small-scale fisheries generally have lower discard rates than industrial fisheries. The small-scale fisheries account for over 11 percent of the discard database landings and have a weighted discard rate of 3.7 percent. Evidence is presented for a substantial reduction in discards in recent years. The major reasons for this are a reduction in unwanted bycatch and increased utilization of catches. Bycatch reduction is largely a result of the use of more selective fishing gears, introduction of bycatch and discard regulations, and improved enforcement of regulatory measures. Increased retention of bycatch for human or animal food results from improved processing technologies and expanding market opportunities for lower- value catch. A number of policy issues are discussed. These include a no-discards approach to fisheries management; the need for balance between bycatch reduction and bycatch utilization initiatives; and concerns arising from incidental catches of marine mammals, birds and reptiles. The study advocates the development of more robust methods of estimating discards, allowance for discards in fishery management plans, development of bycatch management plans and promotion of best practices for bycatch reduction and mitigation of incidental catches. Global discard estimates could achieve greater precision through additional studies at national and regional levels.},

abstract = {The spawning stock of North Sea cod is at a historic low level and immediate management measures are needed to improve this situation. As a first step, the European Commission in 2001 closed a large area in the North Sea between February 15 and April 30 to all cod related fishing fleets in order to protect the spawning population. The closed area comprised important fishing grounds of the beam trawl fleet fishing for flatfish. In this paper the response of the Dutch fleet (components 225-300hp and {\textgreater}300hp) is analysed using data from EU-logbooks and from position recordings from the Vessel Monitoring System. No change was observed in the fleet of small beam trawlers. The fleet of large vessels displaced its activity to fishing grounds in the North Sea outside the closed areas, and to fishing grounds outside the North Sea. In the North Sea, beam trawling concentrated along the borders of closed areas and the Plaice Box. In the first week after the closure the number of trips in the open area doubled. Coinciding with this increase, the catch rate, expressed as revenue per hp-day, decreased. After the area was re-opened, the catch rate was exceptionally high but decreased to the normal level in the 2nd - 3rd week. The change in catch rate in relation to the change in fishing effort indicated that competitive interactions (in particular interference interactions) occurred among vessels. The implication of the observed fleet response is discussed against the background of the objective of the management measure to protect cod and the broader objective of the Common Fisheries Policy of ecosystem management. It is concluded that it is unlikely that cod has benefited from the area closure. Furthermore, the closure may have had a negative impact on the rate of discarding of demersal species and a negative impact on vulnerable components of the ecosystem (e.g. skates, long lived benthic species) due to an increase in trawling activities in certain areas },

Our model simulates a fishery that occurs in several adjacent fishing grounds. The spatial distribution of catch and effort is based on a simplification of the Baranov catch equation, the relationship between fishing efficiency and local fishing effort (interference), and the assumptions of the ideal free distribution.

The scheme was expanded in 2009, building on the initial elements of real-time closures (RTCs) and gear requirements. Various measures were agreed in a co-management framework involving fishers, non-governmental organizations, government officials, and scientists. The main objective was to encourage cod avoidance and the reduction of cod discards using spatial tools such as RTCs and seasonal closures, along with gear options that reduce cod capture. The scheme was incentivized by rewarding participation with additional days at sea. Real-time monitoring was carried out with extensive use of fishery-dependent information, allowing management to be adapted as required and to address emerging problems. The use of vessel monitoring system data, logbook records, fishers' knowledge, and observer data is described in terms of implementing and assessing the scheme. Compliance with the closure elements of the scheme was judged to have been good, and estimated catch rates by the Scottish fleet met target criteria, but the assessed catch savings of cod from RTCs were less than predicted. Modifications to the scheme were introduced for 2010, reflecting improved knowledge and expirience.},

@article{Branch2005,
abstract = {A large part of fishing behavior is choosing where to fish. Trawl skippers usually choose between known fishing opportunities, which are observed as groups of trawls that are conducted in the same portion of a fishing ground, or go exploratory fishing. We outline a simple clustering method based on Euclidean distances between trawls that offers a more realistic way of defining fishing opportunities than grid cells or statistical areas. The resulting cluster tree of trawls is divided into individual groups of trawls (fishing opportunities) using a recommended cut point. Our method correctly classified simulated trawls into fishing opportunities. Fishing opportunities were obtained for vessels in the British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery; each vessel usually fished at a wide variety (mean 26, standard devia- tion 16, range 2–69) of fishing opportunities. Within each fishing opportunity, trawls generally caught similar species. In the Argentina scallop fishery, our method was able to divide exploratory from regular fishing trawls, with obvious applications for catch-per-unit-effort calculations. Our method could also be used to detect positional errors in data from these fisheries. Fishing opportunities could provide indications of how fishermen might react to marine protected areas and to the imposition of quotas on multispecies fisheries.},

@article{Baudron2014,
abstract = {Many commercial fish stocks are beginning to recover under more sustainable exploitation regimes. In this study, we document the temporal and spatial changes in one remarkable example of stock recovery: northern European hake (Merluccius merluccius). Analysing data from several scientific surveys, we document a dramatic increase in estimates of biomass between 2004 and 2011 throughout the larger area now occupied by the stock. The largest increase occurred in the North Sea, where hake have been largely absent for over 50 years. Spatio-temporally resolved commercial landings show that high densities occur in the North Sea only between April and September, suggesting a density-dependent seasonal habitat expansion to suitable temperature and depth conditions. These changes have implications for the management of the stock which are discussed. Notably, if discards are banned as part of management revisions, the relatively low quota for hake in the North Sea will be a limiting factor (the so-called ‘choke' species) which may result in a premature closure of the entire demersal mixed fishery in the North Sea, jeopardiz- ing many commercial fisheries in the region. This example of the unforeseen conse- quences of improved stewardship highlight the need for a more holistic, regional and responsive approach to managing our marine ecosystems.},

@article{Bastardie2010,
abstract = {Individual tracking of commercial fishing vessels from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) is now widely available across Europe for scientific purposes. This enables analyses of the spatial and temporal distribution of disaggregated fishing activity as well as high resolution determination of the consequent relative fishing pressure on stocks, provided that an accurate method can link these data with the declaration of catches (logbooks). In the present study, logbook analyses to allocate the fishing activity due to various fisheries (fleet segments) are integrated with processing of raw satellite-recorded data for identifying trips at sea and fishing sequences. Both data sources are linked into one output dataset. A robust method is developed to allocate logbook catches to VMS positions, with focus on potential mismatch. The method is applied to data on the Danish Skagerrak-Kattegat fishing fleets from 2005 to 2008, where 52-56{\%} of the VMS total effort perfectly matched (representing approximately 80{\%} of landings); 14-18{\%} partially matched; and 30{\%} failed to match the logbook data, which was partially related to fleet type, area and year. Comparison of three methods for generating high resolution determination of grid-based fishing effort demonstrated only minor differences, suggesting a mainly equal dispatch of landings between each of the merged fishing positions. Despite possibly poor matching success for this particular region, we demonstrate that the approach can cope with the potentially large sources of error in the data, including the current low accuracy of available VMS pre-processing algorithms and the possible misreporting of areas and catch dates in fishermen's logbook declarations. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A temporarily closed area established to protect spawning Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea allowed us to study the response of the Dutch beam trawl fleet exploiting common sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). A number of vessels left the North Sea 1 month earlier than the normal seasonal pattern. The vessels that continued fishing in the North Sea were concentrated in the remaining open areas. In the first week after the closure, the catch rate decreased by 14{\%}, coinciding with an increase in crowding of 28{\%}. Area specialisation affected the response of individual vessels because vessels without prior experience in the open areas showed a larger decline in catch rate compared with vessels that previously fished in these open areas and were more likely to stop fishing during the closed period. The decrease in catch rate in response to the increase in competitor density allowed us to estimate the strength of the interference competition},
