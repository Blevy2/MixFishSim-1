species-unselective gear that can result in unintended, unwanted catch of low

\replaced[id = PD]{If fisheries are to avoid unwanted catch}{To implement
	effective spatial measures to reduce discards} a good understanding of
spatiotemporal fishery dynamics is required. However, traditional scientific
advice is limited by a lack of highly resolved knowledge of population
distributions, movement and how fishers interact with different fish
populations. This reflects the fact that data on fish location at high temporal
and spatial resolutions is expensive and difficult to collect. Proxies inferred
from either scientific surveys or commercial catch data are often used to model
distributions, often with data at limited spatial and temporal resolution. \\ 

To understand how data resolution impacts inference on mixed fisheries
interactions, we develop a highly resolved spatiotemporal simulation model
incorporating: i) delay-difference population dynamics, ii) population movement
using Gaussian Random Fields to simulate patchy, heterogeneously distributed
populations, and iii) fishery dynamics for multiple fleet characteristics based
on species targeting via a mix of correlated random walk movement (for
exploration) and learned behaviour (for exploitation) phases of the fisheries.
\\ 

We simulate 50 years of fishing and use the results from the fisheries catch to
draw inference on the underlying population structures. We compare this
inference to i) a simulated fixed-site sampling design commonly used for
fisheries monitoring purposes, and ii) the true underlying population
structures input to the simulation, to establish the potential and limitations
of fishery-dependent data - an inherently biased sampling method due to
fisher's targeting- to provide a robust picture of spatiotemporal
distributions. Finally, we simulate an area closure based on areas defined from
commercial the known ("real-population") distribution, commercial catch data
and survey data at different temporal and spatial resolutions and assess their
effectiveness on reducing catches of a fish population. \\

We conclude from our simulations that commercial data, while not unbiased,
provides a useful tool for managing catches in mixed fisheries if applied at
the correct spatiotemporal scale. \\

\section{Introduction}

Fishers exploit a variety of fish populations that are heterogeneously
distributed in space and time with varying knowledge of species distributions
using species-unselective fishing gear. \added[id=PD]{In doing so} fisheries
\deleted[id=PD]{that} catch an assemblage of species
\added[id=PD]{and}\deleted{, known as mixed fisheries} \replaced[id=JJ]{may}{,
	when managed by single-species quotas can end up}
discard\deleted[id=JJ]{ing} overquota catch \added[id=JJ]{when managed by
	single species quotas,} leading to overexploitation of fish populations
\added[id=JJ]{\citep{Ulrich2011a, Batsleer2015}}.  \added[id=JJ]{This
	discarding of fish in excess of quota hampers the ability to limit
	fishing mortality to within sustainable limits \citep{Alverson1994,
		Crowder1998, Rijnsdorp2007}} \deleted[id=PD]{; reducing
	discarding is crucial}and ensure biological and economic sustainability
of fisheries\deleted[id=JJ]{ and implementation of an ecosystem approach to
	fisheries}. As such, there is increasing interest
in technical solutions such as gear and spatial closures as ways of
\replaced[id=PD]{reducing unwanted catch}{avoiding discard\added[id=JJ]{ing of
		fish}}\citep{Kennelly2002, Catchpole2008, Bellido2011}.  \\

\replaced[id=PD]{Changes to spatial fishing patterns have}{Use of spatial
	management as a tools} been proposed as a method to reduce discards
\added[id=PD]{\citep{Holmes2011, Little2014, Dunn2014a}}. However,
\deleted[id=PD]{its} implementation is hampered by lack of knowledge of fish
and fishery spatiotemporal dynamics and understanding of the scale at which
processes are important for management. Understanding the correct scale for
spatial management is crucial in order to implement measures at a resolution
that ensures effective management \citep{Dunn2016} while minimising economic
impact.  For example, a scale that promotes species avoidance for vulnerable or
low quota species while allowing continuance of sustainable fisheries for
available quota species.\\

\replaced[id=PD]{Identifying}{Ensuring measures are implemented at} an
appropriate scale has been a challenge in the past that has led to ineffectual
measures with unintended consequences such as limited impact towards the
management objective or increased benthic impact on previously unexploited
areas (e.g. the cod closure in the North Sea
\citep{Rijnsdorp2001,Dinmore2003}). \replaced[id=PD]{M}{Since then m}ore
refined spatial information has \added[id=PD]{since} become available through
the combination of logbook and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data
\citep{Lee2010, Bastardie2010, Gerritsen2012, Mateo2016} and more real-time
spatial management has been possible \citep[e.g.][]{Holmes2011}.  Such
information is, however, patchy and derived from an inherently biased sampling
programme (i.e. targeted fishing). \deleted[id=PD]{ Further, fishers generally only recorded
landings (not catch) on a daily basis\todo{\added[id=JJ]{Its not clear what the
		problem is: landings collected on daily basis or landings
		recorded rather than catch}}.  This leads to questions about
the validity of inference that can be drawn from landings data assigned to VMS
activity pings.}\todo{\added[id=JJ]{This comes as a surprise: I thought this was
		going to be about discards}\added[id=PD]{Agree, have removed
		this to avoid confusion}}\\ 

In order to understand \replaced[id=PD]{the consequences of using}{challenges
	that face} VMS-linked landings to draw inference on the underlying
population structure we develop a simulation model where population dynamics
are highly-resolved in space and time\replaced[id=PD]{. Being}{ and are}
known \added[id=PD]{directly} rather than inferred from sampling or commercial
catches \added[id=PD]{, we can use the population model to evaluate how inference from
	fisheries-dependent and fisheries independent sampling relates to the
	real population structure}. \replaced[id=PD]{In our model system
	p}{P}opulation movement is driven by random (diffusive) and directed
(advective) processes and we incorporate characterisation of a number of
different fisheries \added[id=PD]{dynamics} exploiting four fish populations
with different spatial and population demographics.\\

Using our model we simulate \replaced[id=PD]{50}{40} years of exploitation of
the fish populations. \replaced[id=PD]{We}{ and} use the
results\deleted[id=PD]{ from the fishing model:}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item to understand how sampling-derived data reflects the underlying
		population structures. We compare at different spatial and
		temporal aggregations of data the real population to: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item the inferred population from a stratified fixed-site sampling survey design
				commonly used for fisheries monitoring purposes, otherwise know as a
				fisheries-independent survey,
			\item the inferred population from our fishery-dependent model which includes
				fishery-induced sampling dynamics.\\
		\end{enumerate}
	\item to understand the impact of data aggregation and source on
		spatial fisheries management measures we simulate a fishery closure to
		protect a species based on different spatial and temporal data
		aggregations:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item as if the real spatial population structure were
				known,
			\item the fishery-independent inferred population
				structure
			\item the fishery-dependent inferred population
				structure
		\end{enumerate}
		We evaluate the theoretical "benefit" to the population of the
		closure(s), and effect on the other three
		populations\todo{\added[id=JJ]{If the paper has two goals this
				should be clear from the start, but may be
				better over 2 MSs}\added[id=PD]{I would like to
				keep both parts, but have made clearer in how
				its set out. The closure scenarios form
				validation of the data aggregation, rather than
				effectiveness of the closures themselves - so
				its a continuation of the same question in my
				eyes}}\deleted[id=PD]{.  Further, we extend our
			analysis to a range of spatial and temporal scales to
			assess the impact of these processes on the success of
			the management measure.}\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Population dynamics}

The basic population level processes are simulated using a modified two-stage
Deriso-Schnute delay difference model \citep{Deriso1980, Schnute1985,
	Dichmont2003} occurring at a daily time-step. \added[id=PD]{A daily
	time-step was chosen as to discretise continuous population processes
	on a biologically relevent and computationally tractable timescale.}
\replaced[id=PD]{Under the popualation dynamics module}{Here,} population
biomass growth and depletion for pre-recruits and \deleted[id=PD]{fish}
recruited \added[id=PD]{fish} \deleted[id=PD]{to the fishery} are modelled
separately as a function of previous recruited biomass, intrinsic population
growth and recruitment:

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	B_{c,d+1} = &\\
	& (1 + \rho) B_{c,d} \cdot e^{-Z_{c,d}} - \rho \cdot e^{-Z_{c,d}} \hspace{2.9cm}
	\times \\  
	& (B_{c,d-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{c,d-1}} + Wt_{R-1} \cdot \alpha_{d-1} \cdot
	R_{\tilde{y}(c,y,d-1)})
	\hspace{0.4cm} + \\
	& Wt_{R} \cdot \alpha_{d} \cdot R_{\tilde{y}(c,y,d)} 
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

where $\rho$ is Brody's coefficient, shown to be approximately equal to
$exp(-K)$, where $K$ is the growth rate from a von bertalanffy logistic growth
model \citep{Schnute1985}. $Wt_{R-1}$ is the weight of fish prior to
recruitment, while $Wt_{R}$ is the recruited weight. $\alpha_{d}$ represents
the proportion of fish recruited during that day for the year, while
$R_{\tilde{c,y}}$ is the annual recruits in cell $c$ for year $y$. \\

Mortality $Z_{c,d}$ can be decomposed to natural mortality, $M_{c,d}$, and
fishing mortality, $F_{c,d}$, where both $M_{c,d}$ and $F_{c,d}$ are
instantaneous rates with $M_{c,d}$ fixed and $F_{c,d}$ calculated by solving
the Baranov catch equation \citep{Hilborn1992b} for $F_{c,d}$:

\begin{equation*}
C_{c,d} = \frac{F_{c,d}}{F_{c,d} + M_{c,d}} * (1 - e^{-(F_{c,d} + M_{c,d})}) *
B_{c,d}
\end{equation*}

where $C_{c,d}$ is the summed catch from the fishing model across all fleets
and vessels in cell $c$ for the population during the day $d$, and $B_{c,d}$
the daily biomass for the population in the cell. \todo{\added[id=CM]{[link $F$ to
	effort and catchability - as I think we have F as an emergent property
	of the fleets rather than something we solve for (I could be wrong
	though!) - catch for a vessel is a product of catchability and biomass,
	i.e. C = qB, but this catch is summed to solve for F. So its both
	really]}}\\

\subsection{Recruitment dynamics}

Recruitment is modelled through a function relating the mature biomass to
recruits at time of recruitment. In \emph{mixfishsim}, it can be modelled
either either as a stochastic Beverton-Holt stock-recruit form
\citep{Beverton1957}: 

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\bar{R}_{c,d} = & \frac{(\alpha * B_{c,d})}{(\beta + B_{c,d})} \\
	     R_{c,d} \sim & \log N[(\log(\bar{R}_{c,d}),\log(\sigma^2))]
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Where $\alpha$ is the maximum recruitment rate, $\beta$ the spawning stock
biomass (SSB) required to produce half the maximum, $B$ current SSB and
$\sigma^2$ the variability in the recruitment due to stochastic
processes. \\

or a stochastic Ricker form \citep{Ricker1954}:

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\bar{R}_{c,d} = & B_{c,d} * e^{(\alpha - \beta * B_{c,d})} \\	
   	     R_{c,d} \sim & \log N[(\log(\bar{R}_{c,d}),\log(\sigma^2))]
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

where $\alpha$ is the maximum productivity per spawner and $\beta$ the density
dependent reduction in productivity as the SSB increases.

\subsection{Population movement dynamics}

To simulate \deleted[id=JJ]{how} fish population\deleted[id=JJ]{s might be}
distribut\replaced[id=JJ]{ion}{ed} in space and time\deleted[id=JJ]{, we
	employed} a Gaussian spatial process \added[id=JJ]{was employed} to
model habitat suitability for each of the populations\replaced[id=JJ]{. An}{,
	with an} advection-diffusion process \deleted[id=JJ]{to}
control\added[id=JJ]{led} \deleted[id=JJ]{how the} population\deleted[id=JJ]{s}
move\replaced[id=JJ]{ment}{d} over time with a moving temperature covariate to
capture temporal dependencies\todo{\added[id=JJ]{What have a temperature
		covariate? Could just use time}\added[id=PD]{Was intended as
		some biological meaning - species thermal tolerances load onto
		the temperature effect}}. \deleted[id=JJ]{This was intended to
	balance realism in population movement, capturing the main directed and
	random processes, and practicality of modelling the population rather
	than individual fish.} \\


For \deleted[id=PD]{the} habitat we define\added[id=PD]{d} a Gaussian random
field process\todo{\added[id=JJ]{Not clear how habitat/GRF affect local
		abundances, only have $B_{y,d}$}\added[id=PD]{Have included
		cell reference, $c$ to make spatial link explicit}}, $\{S(c) :
c \in \mathbb{R}^2\}$, \deleted[id=PD]{that is a stochastic process} where
\added[id=PD]{for} any set of cells $c_{1}, \dots, c_{n}$ \deleted[id=PD]{where
	for each $c_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^2$}, the joint distribution of $S =
\{S(c1),\dots S(c_{n})\}$ is multivariate Gaussian. The distribution is
specified by its \textit{mean function}, $\mu(c) = E[S(c)]$ and its
\textit{covariance function}\todo{\added[id=JM]{Introduce the gamma function,
		and why this covariance structure? Why correlate values in the
		random field?}\added[id=PD]{to allow populations to have
		different aggregation densities: have tried to clarify}},
$\gamma(c,c') = Cov\{S(c),S(c')\}$ \citep{Diggle2007}.\\

The covariance structure affects the smoothness of the surfaces which the
process generates\replaced[id=PD]{;}{, and} we used the \textit{Matérn}
\deleted[id=PD]{family of} covariance structure\deleted[id=PD]{s},
\replaced[id=PD]{as}{one where} the correlation strength weakens the further
the distance apart \deleted[id=PD]{(i.e. the correlation between $S(x)$ and
	$S(x')$ decreases as the distance $u = ||x - x'||$ increases)}.
\added[id=PD]{The Matérn covariance structure models the spatial
	autocorrelation observed with animal distributions \citep{Tobler1970,
		F.Dormann2007}} \replaced[id=PD]{and}{The \textit{Matérn}
	correlation} is a two-parameter family where: 

\begin{center}
	$\rho(u) = \{2^{\kappa -
		1}\Gamma{\kappa}\}^{-1}(u/\phi)^{\kappa}K_{\kappa}(u/\phi)$
\end{center}
	
$K_{\kappa}(.)$ is a modified Bessel function of order $\kappa$, $\phi >
0$ is a scale parameter with the dimensions of distance, and $\kappa > 0$,
called the order, is a shape parameter which determines the smoothness of the
underlying process. \\

\replaced[id=PD]{T}{In the simulation model, t}he habitat for each of the
populations \replaced[id=PD]{was}{is} generated \replaced[id=PD]{with}{through}
the \textit{RFSimulate} function of the \textit{RandomFields} R package
\citep{Schlater2015}, implementing different parameter settings to affect the
patchiness of the populations. Each population \replaced[id=PD]{was}{is}
initialised at a single location, and subsequently move\replaced[id=PD]{ed}{s}
according to a probabilistic distrib\added[id=PD]{u}tion based on habitat
suitability, temperature and distance from current cell\replaced[id=PD]{:}{.} 

\begin{equation}
	Pr(J | I) = \frac{e^{-\lambda * d_{IJ}} \cdot
		(Hab_{J,p}^2 \cdot Tol_{J,p,wk})}{\sum\limits_{c=1}^{C}e^{-\lambda * d} \cdot
		(Hab_{c,p}^2 \cdot Tol_{c,p,wk})}
\end{equation}

Where $d_{IJ}$ is the euclidean distance between cell $I$ and cell $J$,
$\lambda$ is a given rate of decay, $Hab_{J,p}^2$ is the squared index of
habitat suitability for cell $J$ and population $p$, with $Tol_{J,p,wk}$ the
temperature tolerance for cell $J$ by population $p$ in week $wk$.\\

During specified weeks of the year, the habitat quality
\replaced[id=PD]{was}{is} modified for \added[id=PD]{user-defined} spawning
habitat\deleted[id=PD]{s}, \replaced[id=PD]{resulting in}{meaning} each
population \replaced[id=PD]{had}{has} a concentrated area where spawning takes
place and the population move\replaced[id=PD]{d}{s} towards

\added[id=PD]{Yes, the areas are pre-defined - I have amended to reflect and
	tried to clarify}} \\

The temperature field \replaced[id=PD]{was}{is} simulated to be on a gradient
from a South-Westerly to North-Easterly direction, with temperature in each
cell changing gradually on a week-by-week basis so that initially high
temperature areas cycle\added[id=PD]{d} to lower temperatures and low
temperature areas vice versa. Each population $p$ \replaced[id=PD]{wa}{i}s
assigned a thermal tolerance with mean, $\mu\added[id=PD]{_{p}}$ and variance,
$\sigma^2\added[id=PD]{_{p}}$ so that each cell and population temperature
suitability is defined that:

\begin{equation}
	Tol_{c, p\added[id=PD]{, wk}} = \frac{1}{ \sqrt (2\pi \cdot \sigma^2_{p})} \cdot \exp(-
		\frac{(T_{c\added[id=PD]{, wk}} - \mu_{p})^2}{2 \cdot \sigma^2_{p}} )	
\end{equation}

Where $Tol_{c, p, \added[id=PD]{wk}}$ is the tolerance of population $p$ in
cell $c$ \added[id=PD]{in week $wk$}, $T_{c, \added[id=PD]{wk}}$ is the
temperature in the cell \added[id=PD]{given the week} and
$\mu\added[id=PD]{_{p}}$ and $\sigma^2\added[id=PD]{_{p}}$ the mean and
standard deviation of the population temperature tolerance. \\

\added[id=PD]{The final process resulted in independent populations structure
	and movement patterns, with population movement occuring on a weekly
	basis. This process approximated the demographic shifts in fish
	populations throughout a year while maintaining seasonal patterns for
	spawning.}

\subsection{Fleet dynamics}

The fleet dynamics can be broadly categorised into three components; fleet
targeting - which determine\replaced[id=PD]{d}{s} the fleet catch efficiency
and preference towards a particular species; trip-level decisions, which
determine\added[id=PD]{d} the initial location to be fished at the beginning of
a trip; and within-trip decisions, determining movement from one fishing spot
to another within a trip.

\subsubsection{Fleet targeting}

Each fleet of \textit{n} vessels \replaced[id=PD]{was}{is} characterised by
both a general efficiency, \textit{Q}, and a population specific efficiency,
${Q_{p}}$.  Thus, the product of these parameters affect\replaced[id=PD]{s}{ed}
the overall catch rates for the fleet and the preferential targeting of one
population over another. This, in combination with the parameter choice for the
step-function \added[id=PD]{defined below} (as well as some randomness from the
exploratory fishing process) determine\replaced[id=PD]{d}{s} the preference of
fishing locations for the fleet.  All species prices
\replaced[id=PD]{were}{are} kept the same, across fleets\replaced[id=PD]{and
seasons}{, though can be made to vary seasonally}.  

\subsubsection{Trip-level decisions}

NOTE: THIS IS EXPLORE-EXPLOIT STRATEGY VIZ. BAILEY ET AL POSEIDON MODEL.

Several studies \citep[e.g.][]{Hutton2004, Tidd2012, Girardin2015} have
confirmed past activity and past catch rates are strong predictors of fishing
location choice. For this reason, the fleet dynamics sub-model
include\replaced[id=PD]{d}{s} a learning component, where a vessel's initial
fishing location in a trip \replaced[id=PD]{wa}{i}s based on selecting from
previously successful fishing locations. This \replaced[id=PD]{wa}{i}s achieved
by \added[id=PD]{calculating expected profit from locations fished during}
previous fishing events in the previous trip as well as the previous time
periods in past years, and choosing randomly from the top 75 \% of fishing
events \replaced[id=PD]{as defined by the expected profit}{in value}.
\added[id=PD]{Expected profit was estimated from the revenue from previous
	times fished at a location minus the fuel cost of travelling to the
	location.} Simulation testing indicated that this learning increased
the mean value of catches for the vessels, over just relying on the correlated
random walk \todo{\added[id=JJ]{Correlated random walk of what}} function
\added[id=PD]{as described for the 'within trip' decisions below}. 

\subsubsection{Within-trip decisions}

Fishing locations within a trip are \added[id=PD]{initially} determined by a
modified random walk process. \added[id=PD]{As the simulation progresses, the
	within-trip decision become gradually more influenced by past locations
	fished, based on the same process as the initial location, influenced
	by expected profit at a fishing location.} A random walk was chosen for
the exploratory fishing process as it is the simplest assumption commonly used
in ecology to describe \added[id=PD]{optimal} animal \deleted[id=PD]{movement
	which} search\replaced[id=PD]{ strategy}{ing} for
\added[id=PD]{exploiting} homogeneously distributed prey about which there is
uncertain knowledge \citep{Viswanathan1999}. In a random walk, movement is a
stochastic process through a series of steps\added[id=JJ]{. These steps have a
	length, and a direction} that can either be equal in length or take
some other functional form. The direction of the random walk can be correlated,
(known as `persistence'), providing some overall \deleted[id=PD]{location of}
directional movement \citep{Codling2008} \deleted[id=PD]{or uncorrelated}. \\

A \textit{\replaced[id=JJ]{Lévy flight} {lévy walk}} is a particular form of
random walk characterised by a heavy-tailed distribution of step-length
\replaced[id=JJ]{. The Lévy flight}{and} has received a lot of attention in
ecological theory in recent years as having shown to have very similar
characteristics as those observed by animals in nature, and being a near
optimum searching strategy for predators pursuing patchily distributed prey
\citep{Viswanathan1999, Bartumeus2005, Sims2008}.  \citet{Bertrand2007} showed
that Peruvian anchovy fishermen have a stochastic search pattern similar to
that observed with a lévy walk. However, it remains a subject of debate
\added[id=PD]{\citep[e.g. see][]{Edwards2011, Reynolds2015}}, with the
contention that search patterns may be more simply characteristed as random
walks \citep{Sakiyama2013} with specific patterns related to the
characteristics of the prey field \citep{Sims2012}. \\

We use a modified random walk where directional change is based on a correlated
circular distribution where a favourable fishing ground is likely to be
``fished back over" by the vessel returning in the direction it came from and
step length (i.e. the distance travelled from the current to the next fishing
location) is determined by \deleted[id=JJ]{relating} recent fishing success,
measured as the summed value of fish caught (revenue, $Rev$), $$Rev =
\sum_{p=1}^{P} \replaced[id=PD]{L}{C}_{p} \cdot Pr_{p}$$ where
$\replaced[id=PD]{L}{C}_{p}$ is \replaced[id=PD]{landings}{catch} of a
population $p$, and $Pr_{p}$ price of a population, to step distance. Here,
when fishing is successful vessels remain in a similar location and continue to
exploit the local fishing grounds.  When unsuccessful, they move some distance
away from the current fishing location.  The movement distance retains some
degree of stochasticity, which can be controlled separately. 

The step function takes the form:

\begin{equation*}
	StepL = e^{log(\beta_{1}) + log(\beta_{2}) -
		(log(\frac{\beta_{1}}{\beta_{3}}))} * Rev
\end{equation*}\todo{\added[id=JJ]{So
			step length increases with increasingly gross
			revenue?}\added[id=PD]{No, the opposite}}

So that, a step from (x1,y1) to (x2, y2) is defined by:

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
 (x2, y2) =  & x1 + StepL \cdot \cos (\frac{\pi \cdot Br}{180}), \\
             & y1 + StepL \cdot \sin (\frac{\pi \cdot Br}{180}) \\	
 with  \hspace{0.5cm}     & Br_{t-1} < 180, Br_{t} = 180 + \sim vm[(0,360), k] \\
 			  & Br_{t-1} > 180, Br_{t} = 180 - \sim vm[(0,360), k] \\
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

with $k$ the concentration parameter from the von \replaced[id=JJ]{M}{m}ises
distribution which we correlate with the revenue so that $k = (Rev + 1 /
RefRev) * max_{k}$, where $max_{k}$ is the maximum concentration value, $k$,
and RefRev is parameterised as for $\beta_{3}$ in the step length function. 

\subsubsection{Local population depletion}

Where several fishing vessels are exploiting the same fish population
competition is known to play an important role in local distribution of fishing
effort \citep{Gillis1998}. If several vessels are fishing on the same patch of
fish, local depletion and interference \added[id=JJ]{competition} will affect
fishing location choice of the fleet as a whole \citep{Rijnsdorp2000,
	Poos2007a}. In order to account for this behaviour, the fishing
sub-model operates spatially on a daily time-step so that for future days the
biomass available to the fishery is reduced in the areas fished. The cumulative
effect is to make heavily fished areas less attractive as future fishing
opportunities. 

\subsection{Fisheries independent survey}

A fisheries-independent survey is simulated where fishing on a regular grid
begins each year at the same time for a given number of stations (a fixed
station survey design). Catches of the populations \replaced[id=JJ]{at each
station}{present} are recorded but not removed from the population. This
provides a fishery independent snapshot of the populations at a regular spatial
\replaced[id=JJ]{intervals}{distribution} each year, similar to scientific
surveys undertaken by fisheries research agencies. 

\section{Calculation}

\subsection{Population parameterisation}

We parameterised the simulation model for four populations with differing
habitat preference\replaced{,}{ and} temperature tolerances (Figures
\ref{S-fig:1}, \ref{S-fig:3}, \ref{S-fig:4}, \ref{S-fig:5}, \ref{S-fig:6},
\ref{S-fig:7}), population demographic\replaced{,}{ and} recruitment functions.
In addition, each of the populations has two defined spawning areas which
result in the populations moving towards these areas in given weeks (Figure
\ref{S-fig:2}) and population-specific movement rates (Table \ref{tab:1}). The
realised movement of the populations for a number of weeks is shown in Figure
\ref{S-fig:9} while the realised daily fishing mortality are shown in Figure
\ref{S-fig:10}. \\

\subsection{Fleet parameterisation}

The fleets were parameterised to reflect five different characteristics based
on targeting preference and exploitation dynamics (Table \ref{tab:2}).
\replaced[id=PD]{Setting a targeting parameter ($Q$) that differed across
	fleets ensured different spatial dynamics, due to preferential
	targeting of populations that differ in their spatial
	distributions}{This ensures that different fleets have different
	spatial dynamics, preferentially targeted different fish populations}.
The stochasticity in the random walk process ensures that different vessels
within a fleet have slightly different spatial distributions based on
individual experience, while the step function was parameterised dynamically so
that vessels take smaller steps where the fishing location yields in a top
quartile of the value available in that year (as defined per fleet in Table
\ref{tab:2}). \\

Each fleet was set so that, after the first year, fishing locations were chosen
based on experience built up in the same month from previous years and from
past trip fishing success. 'Success' in this context was defined as the
locations where the top 75 \% of revenue from was found in previous trips.

An example of the realised fleet movements for a single vessel during a single
trip are given in Figure \ref{S-fig:11}, while Figure \ref{S-fig:12} shows
multiple trips for a single vessel, \added[id=PD]{Figure} \ref{S-fig:13} the
vessel movements for some trips overlaid on the value field,
\added[id=PD]{Figure} \ref{S-fig:14} shows fishing locations for an entire
fleet of 20 vessels for a single trip, \replaced[id=PD]{and Figure}{while}
\ref{S-fig:15} shows an example of the step function realisation and turning
angles from the correlated random walk.\todo{\added[id=JJ]{Move some of the
	supplementary figures to the manuscript}}

\subsection{Survey settings}

The survey simulation was set up with follow a fixed gridded station design
with 100 stations fished each year, starting on day 92 \added[id=PD]{and ending
	on day 112 (5 stations per day)} with same catchability parameters for
all populations ($Q_{p} = 1$). 

\subsection{Simulation settings}

To illustrate the capabilities on \emph{MixFishSim}, we investigate the
influence of the temporal and spatial resolution of different data sources on
the reduction in catches of a population given spatial closures. To do so, we
first set up with simulation to run for 10 years based on a 100 X 100 square
grid, with five fleets of 20 vessels each and four fish populations. Fishing
takes place four times a day per vessel and five days a week, while population
movement is every week.\todo{\added[id=JJ]{move to start of methods
		section}\added[id=PD]{I think ecological modelling wants the
		'calculations' section here..will check}} \\

We allow the simulation to run unrestricted for 5 years\todo{\added[id=JJ]{Is
		there equilibrium after 5 years or still some trend in
		B}\added[id=PD]{Not at equilibrium yet...I need to rerun until
		steady state, looks 20 years. Will update}}, and
subsequently close areas for the last 5 years of the simulation based on data
(either derived from the commercial catches, fisheries-independent survey or
the 'real population' - the underlying populations assumed to be known
perfectly) used at different spatial and temporal scales. \\

The following steps are undertaken to determine
closures:\todo{\added[id=JJ]{Procedure unclear. Refer to symbols in
		methods section or switch order starting with description of
		data type	etc..}\added[id=PD]{Yes, will redo}}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Extract data source
	\item Aggregate according to resolution
	\item Interpolate across entire area at desired resoltion
	\item Close top 5 \% of areas
\end{enumerate}

In total 56 closure scenarios were run which represent combinations of

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{data types:} commercial logbook data, survey data and
		'real population',
	\item \textbf{temporal resolutions:} weekly, monthly and yearly
		closures,
	\item \textbf{spatial resolutions:} 1 x 1 grid, 5 x 5 grid, 10 x 10
		grid and 20 x 20 grid.
\end{itemize}

Survey closures were on an annual basis only, as this was the most temporally
resolved survey data available.

\section{Results}

The species distribution themselves 

The consequences of different spatial aggregations of the data are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:1}, which represents the aggregation of catch from each of the
data sources over a year at different spatial resolutions. \\

The finer spatial grid for the the real population (top left) and commercial
data (top middle) show similar patterns, though there are unsampled gaps in the
commercial data from a lack of fishing activity (particularly in the lower left
part of the sampling domain). The survey data at this spatial resolution shows
very sparse and uninformative information about the spatial distributions of
the populations. The slightly aggregated data on a 5 x 5 grid shows similar
patterns, and while losing some of the spatial detail there remains good
consistency between the 'real population' and the commercial data. Survey data
starts to pick out some of the similar patterns as the other data sources, but
lacks coverage. The spatial catch information on a 10 x 10 and 20 x 20 grid
loses a significant amount of information about the spatial resolutions for all
data sources, and some differences between the commercial and 'real population'
data emerge. \\

Figure \ref{fig:2} shows the consequences of different temporal aggregations of
the data, with 156 weekly (top), 36 monthly (middle) and 3 yearly (bottom)
catch compositions across a 20 x 20 area. \\

As can be seen from the 'real population', the monthly aggregation captures the
major patterns seen in the weekly data, albeit missing more subtle differences.
The yearly data results in a constant catch pattern due to the aggregation
process (sometimes known as an aggregation bias). The commercial data on a
weekly basis shows some of the same patterns as the 'real population', though
the first species (in red) is less well represented and some weeks are missing
catches from the area. The monthly data. The monthly data shows some
consistency between the 'real population' and commercial data for species 2 -
4, though species 1 remains underrepresented. On an annual basis, interestingly
the commercial data underrepresents the first species (in red) while the survey
overrepresents species 1. This is likely due to the biases in commercial
sampling, with the fisheries not targeting the areas where species 1 are
present, and the biases in the survey sampling from overrepresentation of the
spatial distribution. \\

We implemented a spatial closure using the different data sources and spatial
and temporal aggregations as outlined in the protocol in Section 3.4. We used
this to assess the efficacy of a closure in reducing fishing mortality on
species 1, given availability of data and its use at different resolutions in
order to evaluate the trade-offs in data sources. Figure \ref{fig:3} shows the
trend in fishing mortality for each species simulated (columns) given the data
sources (rows), temporal aggregations (colour lines) and spatial aggregations
(linestyles), while Figure \ref{fig:4} shows the change in fishing mortality
from before the closure (average F years 2 - 4) to after the closure (average F
years 8 - 10). \\

For the closures based on 'real population' (bottom row), the most
disaggregated data (a weekly timescale and 1 x 1 resolution) was most
effective, reducing fishing mortality on species 1 (left) by $\sim$ 60 \%. Next
was the monthly closures ($<$ $\sim$ 30 \%).  The least effective were the
yearly closures (blue lines) at all spatial resolutions, which resulted in
increased fishing mortalities ($>$ 30 \% - \textcolor{blue}{N.B. Note though,
this is consistent with the increasing trends in F, which is probably more
related to the fact that Fs hadn't stabilised in the simulation from the
fishing vessels "learning" the best locations - I will rerun the sims for a
longer time (20 - 30 years)}. \\

For the survey data, which can only be implemented on a yearly timescale, the
closures had no effect at any data resolution. The results are identical for
the different data resolutions except 20 x 20, which is why you can't see more
than 2 points. This is because of the sparsity of the sampling locations.\\

For the commercial data, the most effective closure scenario was based on 1 x 1
data at a monthly temporal resolution. This results in $\sim$ 10 \% reduction
in F for species 1. \textcolor{blue}{This was the only closure scenario to have
	positive effect according to Figure \ref{fig:4}, though looking at the
	trend in Figure \ref{fig:3} this looks more related to the continued
	increased in F trend, as other scenarios had an initial effect}.
Interestingly the monthly data scenario was more effective than weekly data,
which I'd posit is due to the increase amount of data available from the
commercial sampling across a month compared to a week.i Commercial data used at
an annual timestep was ineffective in bringing fishing mortality down for
species 1. \\

Given the scenarios above, it seems clear that spatial disaggregation is more
important than the temporal disaggregation of the commercial data, except when
its used at an annual timeframe, which is the scenario that gave the worst
results.

For the other species in the simulation (population 2 - 4) there was little
difference in fishing mortalities across scenarios.

\textcolor{blue}{Note: The monthly commercial data scenario is the most
	effective of the realistic scenarios, as the 'real population' can only
	be seen as a baseline comparison.}
