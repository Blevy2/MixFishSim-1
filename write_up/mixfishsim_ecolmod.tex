\section{Introduction}

Fishers exploit fish populations that are heterogenously distributed without
prior knowledge of species distributions and non-selective fishing gear.
Fisheries are managed by single-species quotas, leading to discarding of
overquota catch. Increasing interest in technical solutions such as gear,
spatial closures as a way of managing "fisheries" instead of fish stocks. \\

Provide some examples here of where this is the case..focus on spatial
management and the increasing sophistication / resolution of data dervied from
VMS and logbooks; refs: Geritsen et al, Mateo et al. \\ 

Use of spatial management as a tool is hampered by lack of knowledge of fish
and fishery spatiotemporal dyanmics and the scale at which processes are
important for management. Need to understand these to implement effective
management measures for species avoidance / targeting. Use Dunn et al as a
ref.\\

We develop a simulation model where underlying population dynamics are known
rather than inferred from sampling or commercial catches. It includes
population movement and a number of different fisheries exploiting four fish
populations with different demographics.\\

Using the model, we simulation 20 years of exploitation of the fish populations
and use the results to draw inference on the underlying population structures -
as done in species modelling approaches. \\

We simulate a fishery closure to protect one species based on the
fishery-dependent inferred distributions at a spatial and temporal scale
typical in fisheries management, and assess a theoretical "benefit" to the
population, and effect on the other three populations. Further, we extend our
analysis to a range of spatial and temporal scales to assess the impact of
these processes on the success of the management measure. \\

\subsection{Population dynamics}

The basic population level processes are simulated using a modified two-stage
Deriso-Schnute delay difference model \cite{Deriso1980, Schnute1985}
occurring at the weekly time-step \cite{Dichmont2003}. Here, population
biomass growth and depletion for pre-recruits and fish recruited to the fishery
are modelled separately as a function of previous recruited biomass, intrinsic
population growth and recruitment:

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	B_{y,w+1} = &\\
	& (1 + \rho) B_{y,w} \cdot e^{-Z_{y,w}} - \rho \cdot e^{-Z_{y,w}} \hspace{2.9cm}
	\times \\  
	& (B_{y,w-1} \cdot e^{-Z_{y,w-1}} + Wt_{R-1} \cdot \alpha_{w-1} \cdot R_{\tilde{y}(y,w-1)})
	\hspace{0.4cm} + \\
	& Wt_{R} \cdot \alpha_{w} \cdot R_{\tilde{y}(y,w)} 
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

$\rho$ is Brody's coefficient, shown to be approximately equal to $exp(-K)$,
where $K$ is the growth rate from a von bertalanffy logistic growth model
\cite{Schnute1985}.  $Wt_{R-1}$ is the weight of fish prior to recruitment,
while $Wt_{R}$ is the recruited weight.  $\alpha_{w}$ represents the proportion of
fish recruited during the week, while $R_{\tilde{y}}$ is the annual
recruits. \\

Mortality $Z$ can be decomposed to natural mortality, $M$, and fishing
mortality, $F$, where both $M$ and $F$ are instantaneous rates with $M$ fixed
and $F$ calculated by solving the Baranov catch equation \cite{Hilborn1992b}
for $F$:

\begin{equation*}
C_{w} = \frac{F_{w}}{F_{w}+M_{w}} * (1 - e^{-(F_{w} + M_{w})}) * B
\end{equation*}

where $C$ is the summed catch from the fishing model across all fleets and
vessels for the species, year and week respectively, and $B$ the weekly biomass
for the species. \\


\subsection{Recruitment dynamics}

Recruitment is modelled through a function relating the biomass at time of
recruitment to recruits, either as a stochastic Beverton-Holt stock-recruit
form (\cite{Beverton1957}): 

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\bar{R} = & \frac{(\alpha * B)}{(\beta + B)} \\
	     R \sim & N[(\bar{R},\sigma^2)]
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Where $\alpha$ is the maximum recruitment rate, $\beta$ the spawning stock biomass (SSB)
required to produce half the maximum, and $B$ current SSB; \\

or a stochastic Ricker form \cite{Ricker1954}

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\bar{R} = & B * e^{(\alpha - \beta * B)} \\	
   	     R \sim & N[(\bar{R},\sigma^2)]
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

where $\alpha$ is the maximum productivity per spawner and $\beta$ the density dependent
reduction in productivity as the SSB increases.
